description: "This dataset is a result of a multi-institution, cross country collaboration
  of labs, called International Brain Laboratory conducting standardized experiments
  on decision-making in mice. In the experiment, mice are shown a visual grating on
  screen with varying levels of contrast, and they are trained to rotate a wheel to
  move the on-screen stimulus from either side of their visual field to the center.
  These NWB files contain datasets corresponding to this wheel movement, camera footage
  of mice and information about the visual stimulus at every trial. \nPaper: \nAguillon,
